# USTED Exam Proctoring & Anti-Cheat Platform

Monorepo for the USTED exam proctoring platform. See [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) for the
architecture and phased roadmap, and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the
design system and accessibility requirements (mandatory on every screen).

## Layout

```
apps/web            Next.js app (TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind, shadcn/ui)
packages/proctor-core   Framework-agnostic proctoring engine (shared by System 1 & 2)
docs/                Specs (RESEARCH.md, DESIGN.md)
.github/workflows/   CI + Supabase keep-alive cron
```

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 9+ (`npm i -g pnpm` if you don't have it)

## Setup

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Development

```bash
pnpm dev          # starts apps/web on http://localhost:3000
```

## Verification

```bash
pnpm lint         # ESLint (apps/web)
pnpm typecheck    # tsc --noEmit across all workspace packages
pnpm build        # production build of apps/web
pnpm format       # Prettier write
pnpm format:check # Prettier check (CI-safe)
```

## Design system review

Run the dev server and open `/design` — it exercises every notification
variant, the theme toggle (light / dark / high-contrast), the accessible form
error pattern, a sample table, and icon+text buttons. This is the review
surface referenced by DESIGN.md §5 (Definition of Done).

In development, `axe-core` runs automatically (scanning the page on load and
every few seconds) and logs accessibility violations to the browser console.
(`@axe-core/react` was evaluated but dropped — its own README states it does
not support React 18+; it monkey-patches `React.createElement`, which throws
under React 19's module setup. Calling `axe.run()` directly has no such
issue.)

## Notes for contributors

- All popups/toasts/confirmations must go through `apps/web/lib/notify.ts`.
  Direct `sweetalert2` imports elsewhere are lint-banned.
- Supabase project, R2 bucket, and environment variables are set up in a
  separate pass (Phase 0 part 2) — this scaffold intentionally contains no
  database or auth code yet.
